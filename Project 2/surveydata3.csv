I paid to join the Self-Driving Car Nanodegree that starts on May 25, 2017 the April 08, 2017 and I would like to get a full refund.
I prefer to focus on the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree and will probably do the Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree later once the first one will be finished.

If the button on the home screen updated from ""an email has been sent"" to ""we've received your ID check and survey, your graduation is processing, etc.""

Set aside large chunks of time (3-5 hours) without any distractions so you can get fully immersed in the material. Many times a breakthrough in your understanding or a novel solution only comes after hours of persistent trial and error. It can be frustrating at times, but this is when you learn the most. If you get stuck, seek-out a new perspective (and some inspiration!) by reviewing the approaches that other students have taken. I've found reviewing code and advice on Github and Stack Overflow to be most useful and efficient. The Udacity Slack channels and forums can also be helpful, but they're mostly a disorganized mess. The signal to noise ratio is quite low by comparison. ",Google,,10,"1) I wish the Slack channels weren't such a mess. This isn't really Udacity's fault, but perhaps you could indoctrinate students to use Slack more effectively. For example, educate students to reply within threads instead of posting replies to the main message board. This simple change would make it so much easier to follow the various conversations taking place.

2) I wish there was a way to turn off the mentor notifications. I feel like the mentor program is forced upon us via unwanted pop-ups and emails. If mentors were able to review your code and provide specific technical guidance that would be great! But it's my understanding that mentors only help you plan your work and answer basic questions about program administration. Perhaps I'm wrong, but this is how I interpreted their role based on the Udacity program guidelines. Like most students (I hope), I'm a grown adult and don't need help planning out my work for the week. If I do need help, I will seek it out. I don't like getting repeated pings about mentors without any way to opt-out. Very annoying. ","More prerequisite and language/tool specific courses. Specifically, it would be AMAZING if Udacity offered tiered sets of 3 courses (beginner, intermediate, advanced) for the following subjects:
- Python
- TensorFlow
- C/C++

You should consider buying a company like Treehouse to help produce these types of courses. They do a fantastic job. In my opinion, their courses are much better than the other MOOC platforms like Udemy, CodeAcademy, etc. ","Honestly, I love Udacity. I truly believe it is the future of education. I only wish it had been around when I was younger!",

So as I starter I was apprehensive whether I would be able to  keep up with the advance AI course. So to better Equip myself I went through some courses which were suggested by the udacity team before the beginning of the course. That helped especially going through python as it was the only language in which the course was being delivered.

After the course started, the subject materail was pretty well spread out. It was easy part of the course the challenging parts are the projects where qualifying all the rubrics always posed a desperate challenge to me.

There were times when I wasn't just able to script down the code. I felt frustrated but mentor and forum support were exceptional and I kept going. I can easily recount the during one of the Projects, I just could write a satisfactory heuristic function, soft deadline  had passed week ago and I couldnt get it. It was the time I realised nothing good can be achieved without hardwork. I went through some related material,  took help from my Mentor, Archit  and somehow crosses the river. Post that I dedicated more hours to the course per day. I completed my last project 20 days ahead of deadline :)
I would just say, for those who already have know how of your course, you just need to put in consistent effort not too much and those who are embarking on a truly new course/technology  just remember why did you choose it, how it will effect your future and keep going.

I have to mention a few cons too.
1. The projects rarely meet specifications on the first attempt. Even after closely following the rubrics, I usually had to change some small things to have my project meet specifications. It often felt nit-picky.
2. The quality of the courses varies. Some were a delight to go through while others were more of a slog. I suppose this could apply to any educational experience though.

If you are a good student, the project reviews affirm it whereas if you're not so good, it will help you give a reality check to what is considered wrong in a project/industry which you otherwise thought was the right way to do things. Also, to make through a nanodegree I would advice everyone to fix a schedule rather than pulling random one nighters to complete a chunk of course in one go. Learning in scheduled intervals helps in properly absorbing the course material. Also, dont just try to pass the nanodegree to receive certifcate.

Estimate how long it will take to complete assignments by going through the work and tabulating everything that's required, and then multiply that estimate by three to allow for time to complete that work. Planning is essential to successfully completing a nanodegree program, especially if you are trying to juggle other responsibilities (i.e., work and/or school) as well.

I found it very helpful to also look into additional resources, especially those suggested by the course developers or by your mentor. I often went through lecture material quite quickly, and then supplemented it while working on the assignments/projects.",Google,,9,"It would be helpful for there to be suggested timelines for completing assignments and also estimates as to how long students should spend on each sections and/or assignment (i.e., also incorporating the level of significance for that assignment or each part of an assignment). Perhaps a course google calendar that students can subscribe to may also help with solidifying when assignments are due and when students should be working on what set of lectures. Currently, the runtime of videos for a lecture is shown, and due dates for assignments, but estimated times of completion and perhaps a priority scale beside more important lecture sections may be helpful in knowing how much to allocate to each part of an assignment and/or lecture set.",Numerical techniques and scientific computing.,"The nanodegree program that I am enrolled in is extremely enjoyable, although what might be interesting is the opportunity to collaborate with other students in the program as well, as in through collaborative projects.

One possible way to do this may be to create a large project that can be broken into separate components, and then assign these components to each member of a group (which student may be able to possibly form on the forums) either randomly or after a group discussion. This way, we can not only build a larger-scale project than other nanodegree projects (minus capstone projects), but we can learn to work using collaborative tools (such as git/github) and see how these large projects come together as a sum of its parts.

Although, all else being equal, I can't complain about speed, it's hard to believe that reviewers give each submission very much consideration.","More business skills. Imagine distilling MBA classes down to nanodegrees (e.g. accounting, corporate finance, operations management, project management, managing engineering teams, modelling and optimisation, decision making, information management, macro/micro economics, behavioural finance).

Health-related courses (e.g. biomedical engineering, medical devices, bioinformatics).

Finance, with a focus on the potential value of AI (personal finance, insurance, investing, anomaly detection).","I loved the tech entrepreneurship nanodegree, even though the product I chose wasn't well suited to the course. I wish there was more tech-focused business stuff out there (or, alternately, business focused tech stuff). I think there's a temptation to get so excited about the technology that you forget that it has to add value (whether you measure 'value' by profits or by social impact, or in some other way). I was sorry to see it go.

There could be a greater focus on practice. The practice problems can be a bit superficial (e.g. too much hand-holding). I realise the balance is a tough one.",1.0

Udacity also has a lot of free courses too, some of them quite good.
My suggestion would be to have an advanced section in the courses like (AIND, MLND and SDCND) where the detailed maths is also covered for those few who may be interested. This way Udacity will not just give Engineers but also Scientists who will understand the stuff deeper.
Alternatively, Udacity can start an advanced degree which covers more depth. ","A lot is happening every day, new tools or updated tools emerge every six months.

2) Start the projects early. They usually take more time than some may anticipate",,"Hacker News, when Sebastian announced it, several years ago.",10,"1) All Nanodegrees should have a fixed tuition cost (like AI ND), instead of the monthly fees (like ML ND)

2) You should be able to change cohorts more easily (e.g., AI ND doesn't let you change cohorts. You have a 30 days grace period, and then either you finish or you lose your progress). Some students have a day job, and sometimes not finishing on time doesn't mean lack of dedication, but different availability or priorities. Maybe the 1st change of cohorts is free, and starting with the 2nd there's a small nominal fee, as an incentive for people to not procrastinate.

3) Please please, improve the app, both in terms of usability as well as stability. The Android version is terrible - buggy, offline videos don't always play, pages with two videos play both automatically (e.g., during the Markov Decision section on AI ND), etc. Disclaimer: last time I used was in April, so maybe it improved since then.

4) The Planning Project in the AI ND is truly terrible. Planning is such an important topic for AI, but the project is so archaic and full of copy-and-paste from AIMA pseudocode. Needs to be thoroughly redesigned (and/or maybe making the optional Pacman  project mandatory).

5) I appreciate the option of doing check ins with my mentor, but please *make this optional*. It's extremely annoying to have those pop-ups, plus the fact I can't close them (only minimize).

6) thanks for making the career modules optional in your ND. This was a pain point when I did my first ND in 2014 (Front-End Engineer ND), but you corrected more recently by making it optional. Not everyone is looking for a job or want to directly apply the learnings to their careers; some are doing it just for personal enrichment.","I think you already offer what I'd like to learn.

Be genuinely interested in anything that you are learning. Learn for the fun of it. Don't force yourself because of someone or because you want to get a job or to make money.

2. Be ready to go and learn beyond the coursework. There is no class that will teach you everything about something. Udacity is good but not enough.

3. Failure is common. When you are learning something new, especially from a video online, it is common for you to get stuck. Be patient and not get discouraged. Use the tools like Slack, Forums, Live help from Mentor, and Google. Remember that you are going to solve it, it is just a matter of time.

4. Learn the basics of Linux ( Ubuntu) and start using it in your daily life. You will have to use linux during some part of the course or during your career. Linux is powerful, useful, beautiful, and free. :)

5. Everything will take more time that you have planned.  Always allocate more time. If you have a Full-time job, Spouse/Partner, Kids let them know you are on a mission and you need their support. Share your course schedule with them. Read a thing or two about time management and optimize your day.

6. Don't get discouraged or overwhelmed by the work done by other students or people on the internet. Remember that your peers are from the entire world. There will be people who are much better and talented or have time than you. Never feel inferior, being consistent and persistent will get you closer to your goals. Remember the ""Tortoise and the Hare"" story.

7. Stick to the deadline in the class. Yes, they are soft deadlines and you get a month extension at the end and all that. Completing projects will give you a sense of achievement which will propel you. Ask your family and friends to check on you and keep you on track.

8. Allocate some time to implement the tips from your Project reviewer and to attempt the challenge portion of the project. But please do not get lost trying to solve the challenge and ignore deadlines. If you are short of time,  get your project reviewed and then go back for the challenge.

9. Another time saving tip. Watch the videos or just listen to them even when you are not actively studying. Normally while driving or working around the house you would listen to music or something right? use some of that time to listen to the coursework. Fall asleep watching course videos.

10. Read the Project lesson first. Yes, you won't understand it and it is out of order to do so. But it is useful when you learn a concept in the lesson, you will know where to use it. Or you will know which part of the lesson you can afford to skip or watch in 2x speed.",,Technology blogs,10,"1. More quizzes and explanation to the answers to the quizzes will be helpful.

2. I was able to download udacity lessons on the smartphone app but wasn't able to view them when i had no network connectivity. App needed me to login or something?

3. Can i please play the videos without stop like a playlist when my phone is locked?

4. I am not sure this is possible, but a place in major cities to physically sit and work. Like an official Udacity Library or a Udacity Garage.

This dream Udacity Garage will be open 24 hours, only Udacity students can enter, there will be good wifi.

If i am a poor student or doesn't have a good living situation where i can concentrate or if i am just interested in meeting like minded people and build something new, this will be a good place.

You can probably work with the local universities to provide access or allocate some part of the library would be fine in places where you can't rent out garages.

Simply, this is just a hangout place. you can have cameras installed to prevent unwanted activities.
","Looks good to me as of now. There is more content than i have time to study. But some courses can be more advanced like c++ or some other programming courses. May be they are already there and i don't know.

Is there a technical writing class?","Some weekly/monthly challenges/projects designed based on real-world applications (may be inspired from some of the projects that Udacity Blitz built).

Similar to Kaggle challenges or something for the already graduated students. No guidance or solutions required for these but it will be useful to keep our skills up to date.",1.0

It didn't help that all of his examples were in Keras, a framework we didn't use at all in the course. His sections were also very high-level and not great tutorials.

I think a better way to utilize his talents would be to do a high-level ""get excited about the new topic"" video at the start of each section, then move into the more detailed lessons afterward. Placing his half-hype, half-tutorial videos in the middle of each section was a miss.","This one is hard to answer, Udacity already has a lot I don't know and would like to.","I just picked up a cheap bundle on stackskills. It's ok, but I'm already learning that Udacity's strength is in its active support.

1. Active instructor involvement and response to feedback on Slack
2. Actively fostered slack and forum communities
3. Human review of coding projects. The feedback I received was sometimes copy-pasted but also sometimes very valuable.

I lost alot of sleep and even put a strain on my young family in order to dedicate time to the program. There were countless times I thought about quitting and accepting my role in life. There were many times that I lost hope that an online course would qualify me for any position in the field. But I stuck with it, driven by the encouragement of Udacity coaches and the desire to prove to my daughter that she can do anything. Now, I am proud to say that I not only started a new career, but I got a raise in the process and never in my wildest dreams imagined being this happy at work. It was my Udacity project portfolio that made me a stand out candidate and I can say unequivocally that I would not be on this new, incredible path in life without Udacity. THANK YOU!",1.0
